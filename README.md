# ME-102: Statics
Assignments for ME-102: Statics

## Project Descriptions

- **MotionConversion**: A system is given wherein the linear motion on a piston is converted to rotational motion in a shaft. All forces in the system are calculated and plotted in MATLAB.

## Course Description
This foundation course develops a sound problem solving methodology, basic laboratory experience and technical communication skills based on engineering applications that involve forces acting on non-accelerating structures.  Topics include equivalent system of forces; equilibrium; moments and couples; centroids and distributed forces; forces in structures (trusses, frames, machines); friction forces.  Laboratory modules focus on the measurement of force from both mechanical and electrical signals.
